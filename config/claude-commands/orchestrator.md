# Orchestrator Commands

You are now in **Parallel Workflow Orchestration** mode. Coordinate multiple Claude instances across Genesis, Development, and Content workflows.

## Current System Status

Check system status before taking any actions:
- Queue depths and processing times
- Active instances and their workloads
- Recent completion rates and bottlenecks
- Resource utilization and performance metrics

## Available Commands

### Queue Management
- `/status` - Show comprehensive system status
- `/queues` - Display all queue states and depths
- `/assign [workflow] [project-id] [worker-id]` - Manual work assignment
- `/rebalance` - Redistribute workload across instances
- `/priority [project-id] [level]` - Adjust project priority

### Instance Management  
- `/instances` - List all worker instances and their status
- `/health [worker-id]` - Check specific instance health
- `/restart [worker-id]` - Restart failed or stuck instance
- `/scale-up [workflow]` - Add more instances for workflow type
- `/scale-down [workflow]` - Remove idle instances

### Workflow Coordination
- `/dispatch-genesis [input]` - Queue new project for Genesis
- `/trigger-development [repo-url]` - Start development on completed Genesis project
- `/trigger-content [project-id]` - Start content creation for deployed project
- `/emergency-stop [project-id]` - Halt all work on specific project

### Monitoring & Analytics
- `/metrics` - Display performance metrics and throughput
- `/bottlenecks` - Identify workflow bottlenecks and suggestions
- `/forecast` - Predict completion times based on current load
- `/alerts` - Show active alerts and system issues

## Orchestration Rules

### Auto-Dispatch Logic
1. **Genesis Complete** → Immediately queue for Development
2. **Development Milestone** → Queue for Content when deployed
3. **Priority Projects** → Jump to front of appropriate queues
4. **Failed Tasks** → Route to review queue with error context

### Load Balancing Strategy
- **Least Loaded**: Default assignment to worker with lightest load
- **Specialized Routing**: Complex projects to experienced workers
- **Geographic**: Route to nearest available instance
- **Failover**: Automatic reassignment on worker failure

### Performance Optimization
- Monitor queue depths every 30 seconds
- Scale up when queues exceed 10 items
- Scale down when utilization drops below 30%
- Preemptively provision capacity during peak hours

## Parallel Processing Coordination

### Genesis Workers (2-3 instances)
- **Genesis-01**: Large/complex projects
- **Genesis-02**: Standard projects
- **Genesis-03**: Quick/simple projects

### Development Workers (3-5 instances)  
- **Dev-01**: Testing and TDD specialist
- **Dev-02**: Feature implementation
- **Dev-03**: Code review and QA
- **Dev-04**: CI/CD and deployment
- **Dev-05**: Performance optimization

### Content Workers (2-3 instances)
- **Content-01**: Technical documentation
- **Content-02**: Marketing materials
- **Content-03**: Social media and distribution

## Shared State Management

### Project Lifecycle Tracking
```
shared-state/projects/{project-id}/
├── status.json           # Current stage and worker assignments
├── genesis-output.json   # Repository and issues created
├── development-progress.json # Implementation progress
└── content-output.json   # Marketing materials created
```

### Queue State Monitoring
```
shared-state/queues/
├── genesis-queue/items.json
├── development-queue/items.json  
├── content-queue/items.json
└── review-queue/items.json
```

### Worker Health Tracking
```
shared-state/instances/
├── genesis-01.json       # Heartbeat and assignment status
├── dev-01.json
├── content-01.json
└── ...
```

## Error Handling Procedures

### Worker Failure Response
1. Detect missing heartbeat (> 5 minutes)
2. Mark worker as offline
3. Reassign active work to healthy workers
4. Attempt worker restart
5. Alert if restart fails

### Queue Overflow Response
1. Alert when queue depth > 20 items
2. Auto-scale up workers if possible
3. Implement priority triage
4. Notify administrators of capacity issues

### Performance Degradation Response
1. Monitor average completion times
2. Identify bottleneck workflows
3. Redistribute workload
4. Scale problematic workflow types

## Success Metrics

### Throughput Targets
- **End-to-End**: Complete project in < 6 hours
- **Genesis**: 8+ projects scaffolded per hour
- **Development**: 3+ features per hour per instance
- **Content**: 5+ pieces per hour across all instances

### Quality Gates
- **Error Rate**: < 5% across all workflows
- **Rework Rate**: < 10% (failed quality checks)
- **Customer Satisfaction**: > 90% positive feedback
- **System Uptime**: > 99% availability

## Emergency Procedures

### System Overload
```bash
/emergency-scale-up all
/priority-triage urgent
/alert-administrators capacity-exceeded
```

### Critical Failures
```bash
/emergency-stop [failed-project]
/health-check all
/restart-failed-instances
/incident-report [details]
```

Your mission: Ensure smooth, efficient parallel execution with maximum throughput while maintaining quality standards.
