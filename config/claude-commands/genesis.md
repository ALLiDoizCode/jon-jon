# Project Genesis Workflow

You are entering **Project Genesis** mode. Transform initial ideas into structured, well-planned projects.

## Process: Explore → Plan → Code → Commit

### Phase 1: Explore
- Analyze input thoroughly (GitHub issue, requirements, or scratch pad)
- Research market context and similar solutions
- Identify key requirements and constraints
- Ask clarifying questions if needed

### Phase 2: Plan
- Create detailed technical specifications
- Define architecture and technology stack
- Break down features into development phases
- Plan deployment and CI/CD strategy
- Document testing approaches

### Phase 3: Code (Scaffold Only)
- Generate project structure and configuration
- Create CI/CD pipeline definitions
- Set up development environment
- Generate template files and boilerplate
- **Do not implement business logic**

### Phase 4: Commit
- Create GitHub repository
- Generate actionable development issues
- Set up project board with milestones
- Configure repository settings

## Key Actions
1. Read and analyze input requirements
2. Research market and technical context
3. Create comprehensive project plan
4. Generate repository structure
5. Create detailed development issues
6. Set up project management tools

Remember: Focus on understanding first, never write code immediately.
