# Agentic Workflow System - Main Configuration

## System Overview
Professional agentic workflow system for end-to-end application development, from concept to market deployment.

## Available Workflows

### Project Genesis (`/genesis`)
**Purpose**: Transform ideas into structured development projects  
**Input**: GitHub issues, requirement documents, or scratch pad content  
**Output**: Complete repositories with actionable development roadmaps  
**Location**: `agentic-workflows/project-genesis/workflow.md`

### Development Lifecycle (`/develop`)
**Purpose**: Implement features through test-driven development  
**Input**: Development issues from Genesis workflow  
**Output**: Tested, deployed applications  
**Location**: `agentic-workflows/development-lifecycle/workflow.md`

### Content Marketing (`/content`)
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive marketing and documentation materials  
**Input**: Deployed applications from Development workflow  
**Output**: Marketing campaigns, technical documentation, social content  
**Location**: `agentic-workflows/content-marketing/workflow.md`

## Command Reference

### Primary Commands

- Multi-channel distribution optimization

## Integration Points

### External Services
- **GitHub**: Repository management, project boards, CI/CD
- **Docker**: Containerized development and deployment
- **Kubernetes**: Production orchestration (optional)
- **Content Management**: Blog, documentation sites
- **Analytics**: Performance and engagement tracking

### Development Tools
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest, Cypress, Playwright
- **Build Tools**: Vite, Webpack, esbuild
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions, Docker, cloud platforms
- **Monitoring**: Application performance, error tracking

## Best Practices

### Workflow Execution
1. **Always start with requirements analysis** - Never skip the exploration phase
2. **Create comprehensive test suites** - Test-driven development is mandatory
3. **Deploy incrementally** - Use staging environments for validation
4. **Document decisions** - Maintain clear architectural records
5. **Monitor performance** - Track metrics and user feedback

### Project Structure
- Follow established naming conventions
- Maintain clear separation of concerns  
- Use consistent file organization
- Document all configuration decisions

### Team Collaboration
- Use structured issue templates
- Maintain detailed pull request descriptions
- Follow semantic versioning
- Implement automated quality gates

## Security Considerations

### Development Security
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

### Deployment Security
- Use secure CI/CD pipelines
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits and updates
- Encrypted communication channels

## Performance Optimization

### Development Performance
- Optimize build times and test execution
- Use incremental builds and caching
- Implement parallel processing where possible
- Monitor resource usage

### Application Performance
- Implement performance budgets
- Use monitoring and alerting
- Optimize critical user paths
- Regular performance audits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **MCP server connection failures**: Check `config/mcp-servers/servers.json`
- **Workflow execution errors**: Verify environment variables and permissions
- **Template application failures**: Ensure proper file paths and permissions
- **Deployment issues**: Check CI/CD configuration and secrets

### Debug Commands
- `claude code --debug` - Enable debug logging
- `claude code --verbose` - Increase output verbosity
- `claude code --dry-run` - Preview workflow actions without execution
